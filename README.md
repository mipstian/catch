**[Catch](http://www.giorgiocalderolla.com/index.html#catch)** is a Mac OS X application that runs in the menubar, and will automatically download episodes found in your **[ShowRSS](http://showrss.info/)** feed using your favorite BitTorrent client. You will never miss an episode again :)

It's *free*, and open source.
